#You can check that your key is visible to ssh-agent by running the following command:

ssh-add -L

#If the command says that no identity is available, you'll need to add your key:

ssh-add yourkey

#On macOS, ssh-agent will "forget" this key, once it gets restarted during reboots. But you can import your SSH keys into Keychain using this command:

ssh-add -K yourkey
